Load manually CKEditor
======================

By default, all fields loads the CKEditor library. It means if you have multiple CKEditor fields, there will be
multiple CKEditor library loading (as much as you have fields). If you want to control it, you can configure the
bundle to not load the library at all and let you the control of it. To disable the CKEditor library loading, you can
do it in your configuration or in your widget:

.. configuration-block::

    .. code-block:: yaml

        # app/config/config.yml
        ivory_ck_editor:
            autoload: false

    .. code-block:: php

        $builder->add('field', 'ckeditor', array('autoload' => false));

.. note::

    CKEditor must be loaded before any fields have been rendered, so we recommend you to register it in the ``head``
    of your page.
